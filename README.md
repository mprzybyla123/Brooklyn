# Brooklyn
Unit 5 HW for DDS
The purpose of this project is to:
Clean/format the data with regular expressions
That the pattern "[^[:digit:]]" refers to members of the variable name that start with digits
Use the gsub command to replace them with a blank space
Create a new variable that is a "clean' version
And is numeric, not a factor
Get rid of leading digits
Remove outliers, and plot
